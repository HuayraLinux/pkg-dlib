Subject: Fix library SONAME
 Set library SOVERSION to the library's major version number.
 While this is not considered as a good practice by many
 library packagers, dlib's upstream uses the default cmake
 behavior when SOVERSION is not specified, that is the full
 version number is considered being the SOVERSION, which is
 even worse. Using only the major version number as
 SOVERSION is therefore a good tradeoff between using a
 completely different Debian specific SOVERSION (we'd rather
 like to avoid that), and using upstream's one.
